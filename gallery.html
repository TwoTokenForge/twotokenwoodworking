      <p class="price">$110</p>
      <p>A hand-turned relic in Bog Oak & Gold<br><br>Forged in shadow and shaped by time, The Vessel is not merely a pen — it is a conduit.

The hardware, a polished antique gold, gleams with solemn warmth, lending an air of reverence to every word it commits to page.<br><br>Hand-turned and sealed in a high-gloss friction wax finish, its shape is as distinctive as it is deliberate — contoured for comfort, but whispering of relics passed hand-to-hand in ages gone. Whether resting in your palm or poised above parchment, The Vessel carries the weight of story, craft, and intention.<br><br>Wood: Ancient Bog Oak<br><br>Hardware: Polished Gold<br><br>Finish: Gloss Friction Wax<br><br>Style: One-of-one artisan form<br><br>Name: The Vessel — a channel between mind and material<br><br>✦ Crafted by Two Token Woodworking<br>✦ A forge of sawdust and shadows</p>

      <p class="price">$65</p>
      <p>The Atlantic<br>A Sleep-Forged Relic<br><br>From depths where blue light drifts over the bones of forgotten prayers, The Atlantic rises — a vessel carved in midnight and memory. Inspired by the tides of Sleep Token’s “Atlantic,” this relic evokes the solemn beauty of bodies buried underwater, temples crumbled into silt, and the quiet ache of trying not to feel.<br><br>Its body, hand-turned in hypnotic oceanic acrylic, captures the swirl of dreams and salt, ice and regret — eyes like frozen planets cast in resin. The shape flows like a wave breaking against stone — worn, softened, and dangerous beneath the surface.<br><br>Fitted with a satin nickel hardware kit, this piece balances the cold edge of steel with the depth of abyssal blues. A pen not simply meant to write, but to weather, to flood, to bandage. A pen for those who understand the weight of sleep.<br><br>Crafted by Two Token Woodworking — A forge of sawdust and shadows</p>

      <p class="price">$75</p>
      <p>The Mirefang<br>A Relic of Bone and Bogs<br><br>Unearthed from the drowned places — where time runs thick as tar and memory clings to root and bone — The Mirefang emerges.<br><br>Its form is hewn from ancient Bog Oak, a wood that has slumbered beneath centuries of silence, blackened by decay and pressure into something eternal.

It is a writing tool for the lorekeeper, the oath-maker, the artisan who shapes memory with ink and resolve.<br><br>Crafted by Two Token Woodworking — A forge of sawdust and shadows</p>

Every grain speaks of something burned away, something endured.<br><br>It’s paired with a knurled burnt bronze EDC hardware kit, built for grip, wear, and survival. This is not a pen for ceremony.

This is no war-forged relic. It is a whisper passed down. A vow written in candlelight. A name scratched into stone.<br><br>Hollowlace is weightless in the hand, but heavy with memory — the kind of tool that writes truths, not commands.<br><br>Crafted by Two Token Woodworking — A forge of sawdust and shadows</p>

A proving ground.<br>And beneath its polished calm, it still remembers the first cut.<br><br>Crafted by Two Token Woodworking — A forge of sawdust and shadows<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>FOOD SAFE FINISH</p>
