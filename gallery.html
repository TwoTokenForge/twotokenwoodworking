      <h3>The Vessel </h3>
      <p class="price">$110</p>
      <p>A hand-turned relic in Bog Oak & Gold<br><br>Forged in shadow and shaped by time, The Vessel is not merely a pen — it is a conduit. Hewn from 5,000-year-old Bog Oak, each line etched into its grain speaks of eras long buried. The hardware, a polished antique gold, gleams with solemn warmth, lending an air of reverence to every word it commits to page.<br><br>Hand-turned and sealed in a high-gloss friction wax finish, its shape is as distinctive as it is deliberate — contoured for comfort, but whispering of relics passed hand-to-hand in ages gone. Whether resting in your palm or poised above parchment, The Vessel carries the weight of story, craft, and intention.<br><br>Wood: Ancient Bog Oak<br><br>Hardware: Polished Gold<br><br>Finish: Gloss Friction Wax<br><br>Style: One-of-one artisan form<br><br>Name: The Vessel — a channel between mind and material<br><br>✦ Crafted by Two Token Woodworking<br>✦ A forge of sawdust and shadows</p>

      <h3>The Atlantic</h3>
      <p class="price">$65</p>
      <p>The Atlantic<br>A Sleep-Forged Relic<br><br>From depths where blue light drifts over the bones of forgotten prayers, The Atlantic rises — a vessel carved in midnight and memory. Inspired by the tides of Sleep Token’s “Atlantic,” this relic evokes the solemn beauty of bodies buried underwater, temples crumbled into silt, and the quiet ache of trying not to feel.<br><br>Its body, hand-turned in hypnotic oceanic acrylic, captures the swirl of dreams and salt, ice and regret — eyes like frozen planets cast in resin. The shape flows like a wave breaking against stone — worn, softened, and dangerous beneath the surface.<br><br>Fitted with a satin nickel hardware kit, this piece balances the cold edge of steel with the depth of abyssal blues. A pen not simply meant to write, but to weather, to flood, to bandage. A pen for those who understand the weight of sleep.<br><br>Crafted by Two Token Woodworking — A forge of sawdust and shadows</p>

      <h3>The Mirefang</h3>
      <p class="price">$75</p>
      <p>The Mirefang<br>A Relic of Bone and Bogs<br><br>Unearthed from the drowned places — where time runs thick as tar and memory clings to root and bone — The Mirefang emerges.<br><br>Its form is hewn from ancient Bog Oak, a wood that has slumbered beneath centuries of silence, blackened by decay and pressure into something eternal. Paired with the gleam of imitation buffalo horn, it evokes the fang of some primordial beast — fossilized and sharpened by myth.<br><br>Bound in silver hardware, this relic gleams with cold purpose. It is a writing tool for the lorekeeper, the oath-maker, the artisan who shapes memory with ink and resolve.<br><br>Crafted by Two Token Woodworking — A forge of sawdust and shadows</p>

      <h3>The Stargrave</h3>
      <p class="price">$95</p>
      <p>The Stargrave<br>A Relic of Sky and Silence<br><br>From the ashes of cosmic violence and the stillness of ancient earth, The Stargrave was born — a vessel carved from contradiction. Its body, turned from the bold, violet grain of Purpleheart, pulses with color as if stained by distant nebulae.<br><br>Inlaid with a fragment of meteorite, this relic carries not just the look of the stars — but their touch. What once hurtled through the heavens now rests beneath your fingers, frozen in time and buried in wood.<br><br>Finished in black chrome hardware, this pen balances shadow and shine — a eulogy to what has fallen, and a shrine to what endures.<br><br>Not merely written — this relic is etched across timelines, the kind of artifact found sealed in forgotten tombs or clasped in the hand of a skywatcher long gone.<br><br>Crafted by Two Token Woodworking — A forge of sawdust and shadows</p>

      <img src="assets/Rootwake.png" alt="Rootwake"/>
      
      <h3>Rootwake</h3>
      <p class="price">$75</p>
      <p>Rootwake<br>A Relic of Buried Memory<br><br>Forged from Figured Claro Walnut, whose grain ripples like echoes through loam, Rootwake emerges — not shaped, but revealed. This is no ordinary pen, but the hushed retelling of something old beneath the forest floor. The darkness in its heart, streaked with warmth, suggests both decay and endurance.<br><br>Fitted with a black enamel hardware kit, the piece feels bound — like a blade sealed in shadow, or a secret pressed between roots. Every turn of its form reflects movement through undergrowth and silence, as though the pen remembers every season it once slept through.<br><br>This is a relic of the deepwood — for those who write not only with ink, but with weight.<br><br>Crafted by Two Token Woodworking — A forge of sawdust and shadows</p>

    <div class="item category-pen">
      <img src="assets/Kingswood Vertical.png" alt="The Signet"/>
      
      <h3>The Signet</h3>
      <p class="price">$90</p>
      <p>The Signet<br>A Relic of Crown and Closure<br><br>Turned from regal Kingwood, whose violet-streaked grain once graced the cabinets of kings, The Signet bears the gravity of decisions not easily undone. Its lines are bold, its presence unmistakable — not made for drafting, but for declaring.<br><br>Fitted with an Executive hardware kit in gold and black, this piece gleams with the finality of ceremony — a tool not for writing, but for marking. Every component speaks of ritual: the balance, the tone, the way it catches light like a blade held still.<br><br>The Signet is a pen of thresholds. It belongs in the hand of the one who says “this ends here.”<br><br>Crafted by Two Token Woodworking — A forge of sawdust and shadows</p>

      <img src="assets/embermark EDC.png" alt="Embermark EDC"/>
      
      <h3>Embermark EDC</h3>
      <p class="price">$75</p>
      <p>Embermark<br>A Relic of Flame and Function<br><br>Forged in the red heat of purpose, Embermark bears the signature of fire — not in spark, but in what remains. Turned from deep, vivid Bloodwood, this pen holds the color of smoldering coals and quiet resolve. Every grain speaks of something burned away, something endured.<br><br>It’s paired with a knurled burnt bronze EDC hardware kit, built for grip, wear, and survival. This is not a pen for ceremony. It is a tool for days that demand more — a companion for those who write between scars.<br><br>Whether kept in pocket, pack, or palm, Embermark is made to carry. Made to last.<br><br>Crafted by Two Token Woodworking — A forge of sawdust and shadows</p>

      <img src="assets/hollowlace.png" alt="Hollowlace"/>
      
      <h3>Hollowlace</h3>
      <p class="price">$65</p>
      <p>Hollowlace<br>A Relic of Quiet Decay<br><br>Turned from softly patterned spalted maple, Hollowlace is a relic of delicate contradictions. Its grain weaves like hand-stitched thread across pale wood — veins of time, trails of quiet rot, telling a story too soft for shouting.<br><br>Fitted with a gold and black hardware kit, it bears the grace of something ceremonial — not to be wielded, but offered. This is no war-forged relic. It is a whisper passed down. A vow written in candlelight. A name scratched into stone.<br><br>Hollowlace is weightless in the hand, but heavy with memory — the kind of tool that writes truths, not commands.<br><br>Crafted by Two Token Woodworking — A forge of sawdust and shadows</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item category-cuttingboard">
      <img src="assets/oathslab.jpg" alt="Oathslab"/>
      
      <h3>Oathslab</h3>
      <p class="price">$195</p>
      <p>Oathslab<br>A Relic of Edge and Ritual<br><br>Forged from end grain Black Walnut and Spalted Maple, Oathslab bears the marks of time and pressure — swirls like tree rings echoing through storms, and the jagged ghosts of decay immortalized in grain. Each segment is a fracture of nature’s own script, bound together in ceremony.<br><br>Its rounded top edge invites the hand, while the chamfered underside and lift grooves whisper of thoughtful craftsmanship — a board meant not only to be used, but respected. Whether cradling the weight of a cleaver or the precision of a paring knife, Oathslab answers without hesitation.<br><br>This is more than a surface. It is a memory keeper. A proving ground.<br>And beneath its polished calm, it still remembers the first cut.<br><br>Crafted by Two Token Woodworking — A forge of sawdust and shadows<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>FOOD SAFE FINISH</p>
